# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction App

This is an interactive Streamlit web app that predicts whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on their characteristics using a **Logistic Regression** model.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Input passenger details through a simple sidebar interface.
- Predict survival outcome using a trained logistic regression model.
- Displays survival probability as a percentage.
- Automatically trains and caches the model if not already saved.

## ðŸ§  Model

The model is trained using the classic **Titanic dataset** (`titanic.csv`) with the following features:

- Pclass (Passenger class)
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (Siblings/Spouses aboard)
- Parch (Parents/Children aboard)
